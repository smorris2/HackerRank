Task: print out a simple "hello, World!" prompt with a "Hello, Java!" prompt below.

A simple task enough. 

Pre-build appearance: 

public class Solution {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        /* Enter your code here. Print output to STDOUT. Your class should be named Solution. */
        }
}

println is the basic output used for creating printed lines. 
3 types of prints:

 * print   - basic print function. prints on same line. Not a lot of functionality.
 * println - print function that prints on the next line. Handy for input/output 
 * printf  - also can be called with System.out.format(). selective formatting with print output.


format specifiers:
 %c - character
 %d - decimal (integer) number (base 10)
 %e - exponential floating-point number
 %f - floating-point number
 %i - integer (base 10)
 %o - octal number (base 8)
 %s - String
 %u - unsigned decimal (integer) number
 %x - hex number (base 16)
 %t - formats into date/time
 %% - prints a percent sign.
 \% - prints a percent sign.
 %n, \n - line separators

escape characters:
 \b - backspace
 \f - next line the first character starts to the right of the current line of the last character
 \r - carriage return (?)
 \t - tab
 \\ - backslash
Format: %<flags><width><.precision>specifier
flags can be set as + for right-aligning, and - for left-aligning
