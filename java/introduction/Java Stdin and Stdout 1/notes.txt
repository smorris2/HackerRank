stdin - standard input
stdout - standard output

both are classes that handle interactions between between user and the computer.

One way to read inputs from stdin is by using the Scanner class

requirements:

-needs to call util library (at top of page, type 'import java.util.*;' in most cases.)
  -this will unlock all class libraries in util repository, including scanner and stds

structure: 

Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
// classifies a new scanner with the name 'scanner'
String myString = scanner.next();
//variable string for example. scanner.next() calls all inputs in the function.
int myInt = scanner.nextInt();
//
scanner.close();
//closes scanner (important)
System.out.println("myString is: " + myString);
System.out.println("myInt is: " + myInt);

preform:

import java.util.*;

public class Solution {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
        int a = scan.nextInt();
        int b = scan.nextInt();
        int c = scan.nextInt();
        //write code below///
        }
      }
